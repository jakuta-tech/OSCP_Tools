# Intro

This is a cheat sheet for exploitation of OWASP Top 10.

It is the followed by more refined attacks. 

# OWASP Top 10

## Command Injection

If Backend has an insecure function that passes user input directly to shell, it can be exploited.

Try injecting the following:
```
# Linux

whoami
id
ifconfig/ip addr
uname -a
ps -ef


# Windows

whoami
ver
ipconfig
tasklist
netstat -an
```

For bypassing WAF and more advanced injections your best friend is as always: Payload all the thins.

## Broken Authentication

If an attacker is able to find flaws in an authentication mechanism, they would then successfully gain access to other usersâ€™ accounts.

1. Try manipulating session cookies to see if they are predictable
2. Manipulate GET requests containing IDs or usernames
3. Register as user with similar name: add space " admin" or numbers
