# Why is it useful?

When testing AD I always need same tools. So instead of downloading them everytime, I have made a collection of working binaries here. For the sorcecode refer to original authors. Best practice is always to recompile the tools: should YOU trust ME? :)

# Anti Virus

* sometimes when you use those tool on your own system AV can flag them
* in this case it is most of the time helpful to just to recompile the binary (Anti Virus is great!!!...NOT!)
